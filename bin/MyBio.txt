Hello Everyone!
My name is Aaryash Raj Sinha and I am a student of Computer Science-CCVT(2017-2021). I was born in Patna and completed  my schooling from Vizag. 
My interests are mostly aligned towards learning new technologies, instruments, gaming and sports. I have been working in paid internships, as a Graphic Designer. I am currently exploring the field of security and would surely love to continue gaining knowledge in this domain.
I have an unconditional love for hiking as it combines my love for being active with my desire to be adventurous and discover new places. Hiking has been teaching me the ability to deal with tough situations, which is doubtlessly a strong ordeal. Travelling through the new paths has unconsciously made me realize the importance of a few qualities that I feel everyone should learn, 
leadership, management and decision making.
I aim of two things as of now,
To continue my studies after my bachelor's degree and persue a master's degree; Become a traveller and hike more, across the world.
I hope you enjoyed reading my introduction.

Thank you.
